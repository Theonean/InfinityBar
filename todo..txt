7.3.2023:

add different fruit that can fall --> DONE
add robot that follows movement and can only move in middle segment --> DONE

14.3.2023:


Idea to implement:
Setting of the website is the Inside of a room, pixelstyle 
the room has various relaxing elements you can play around with:
in the left part there are 3 effects which you can toggle:
    -bubble shooter on/off
    -lavalamp on/off
    confettishooter on/off

have a robot factory in the middle part, when you click a fruit a robot comes out
of the factory and collects the fruit and throws it into the top of the factory


28.3.2023 (the whole week)
sprites needed:
waterbubble
waterbubble-shooter
roomba - follows mouse on floor
fruitmachine - shoots fruits into air or drops them into pipe so they vanish, can be cut inbetween
canvas - can be drawn on by user
 different office stuff that could be interesting to interact / click or

 new Idea maybe visually more interesting:
 Website is from the front view of a Bar (inspired by barkeeper flash game)
 on the bar there is a bubbleshooter (element bubble integrated, jay)
 and behind the counter a bartender who wobbles around slightly. You can get him to do stuff?
 
 -remove fruit - DONE
 -set bubbles to upwards and smaller
 -add bartender whose eyes follow mouse - started that
 -remake bar in HTML/CSS style with white boxes, clean look -- did it in Pixelart

 -create starting animation for when website is loaded
 -different elements of bar are animated into position

1.4.2023
create generic barElement class 
    -on loading it creates a new div 
    -sets class to input from constructor
    -set location

I create a new barElement  
    I set its className
    i set its startingPoint

element slides into scene

create json with all startingelements for the Infinitybar (wall, floor etc) with the required information
loop over it and spawn all of it, either with the satisfying algorithm or the random starting point one (chaos)

later todo
generate content outside of current barbounds
